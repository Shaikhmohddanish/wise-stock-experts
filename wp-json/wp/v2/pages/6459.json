Therefore, we recommend adhering to the following do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts for optimal results:<\/p><p>1. Always use a Stop Loss when trading or investing.<br \/>2. Ensure your Stop Loss is placed within the trading terminal and avoid relying on mental stop losses.<br \/>3. Set a Target order in the system to secure profits at your desired price.<br \/>4. Trade with a portion, not all, of your capital in each trade.<br \/>5. Never risk your entire capital on a single trade.<br \/>6. Minimize trading with leverage whenever possible.<br \/>7. Focus on capital protection; systematic trading can yield long-term profits when capital is safeguarded.<br \/>8. We at Trades Mantra will never request your D-mat\/Trading account Login ID &amp; Password. Please disregard any such requests and promptly inform us via our official email.<br \/>9. All recommendations will be communicated exclusively through our mobile application. Kindly download it for updates, or contact our customer support for assistance.<\/p><p>For instance, if your capital amounts to Rs. 5 lakhs, consider investing only Rs. 50,000 in any single trade. Diversification is key here; it reduces the impact on your overall capital if a trade doesn&#8217;t go as planned and your stop loss is triggered. Diversifying trades enhances the probability of long-term profitability while reducing the risk of significant capital loss.<\/p><p>We trust that you will adopt these practices to guide your trading and investing decisions effectively.<\/p><p>Thank you.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Investment in the stock market is subject to market risk, we DO NOT offer any guaranteed profit services or Fixed Returns Services.
